# The Art of Presentation

Lessons from a frontier saloon



![The presenter @fill](images/saloon-horizontal.png)



# Why Presentations Matter

+ Ideas don't spread themselves
+ A great talk can change minds in 20 minutes
+ A bad one can waste an hour of everyone's time



## Part One: Structure



# The Three-Act Structure

- **Act I** — Set the stage. What problem are we solving?
- **Act II** — The journey. Show the work, the struggle, the insight.
- **Act III** — The payoff. What changed? What's next?

***

Every great presentation tells a story.



# Slide Economy

+ One idea per slide
+ If you need a wall of text, write a document instead
+ Slides are *scaffolding* for your words, not a transcript

> Your slides should make the audience want to hear what you say next — not read ahead.



# The Opening

+ Start with a question, a story, or a surprise
+ Never start with "Today I'm going to talk about..."
+ You have 30 seconds to earn attention

```markdown
# Bad Opening
Today I will present our Q3 results and discuss
the implications for our strategic roadmap.

# Good Opening
Last quarter, we bet everything on a hunch.
Here's what happened.
```



## Part Two: Design

A good presenter commands the room — not the screen.



# Typography

- Headlines: bold, short, scannable
- Body text: readable at the back of the room
- Code: monospaced, syntax-highlighted, never more than 15 lines

+ **Rule of thumb:** if you can't read it from 3 meters away, it's too small.



# Color and Contrast

@layout: two-column

**Light themes:**

- Clean and professional
- Best for well-lit rooms
- High contrast for text
- Muted accents

+++

**Dark themes:**

- Dramatic and focused
- Best for dim rooms
- Easier on the eyes
- Colors pop more



# Images

+ Use images that *add meaning*, not decoration
+ One strong image beats three mediocre ones
+ Full-bleed images create impact

# Data Visualization

| Chart Type | Best For |
|------------|----------|
| Bar chart | Comparing categories |
| Line chart | Trends over time |
| Pie chart | Almost nothing (seriously) |
| Table | Exact values, small datasets |

+ Keep it simple. If your chart needs a legend with 12 entries, simplify.



## Part Three: Delivery



# Pacing

```@diagram
- Opening    (icon: user,     pos: 1,1)
- Build-up   (icon: function, pos: 2,1)
- Climax     (icon: monitor,  pos: 3,1)
- Resolution (icon: storage,  pos: 4,1)

- Opening -> Build-up: hook them
- Build-up -> Climax: raise stakes
- Climax -> Resolution: deliver value
```



# Handling Nerves

+ Preparation kills anxiety — rehearse out loud at least twice
+ Arrive early and own the space
+ Remember: the audience wants you to succeed

***

*Nobody notices your nerves as much as you do.*



# The Q&A

- Repeat every question before answering
- "I don't know" is always better than a bad guess
- End with a prepared closing statement, not an awkward silence

+ Plant a question with a colleague if you're worried about dead air.



# Common Mistakes

+ Reading slides word-for-word
+ Facing the screen instead of the audience
+ Cramming 40 slides into a 20-minute slot
+ Apologizing for your own slides



> The secret of a good presentation is simple: know your story, respect your audience, and get out of their way.



# Thank You

Now go build something worth presenting.
